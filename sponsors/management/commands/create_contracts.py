# The reason to not use a data migration but a django management command
# to deal with pre existing approved Sponsorships is due to migrations
# limitations. A new Contract for a Sponsorship is created by the Contract's new
# classmethod. This method operates directly in top of other models such as
# SponsorBenefits and LegalClauses to organize the contract's information.
# A data migration would have to re-implement the same logic since the migration,
# when running, doesn't have access to user defined methods in the models.
# The same limitation is true for the SponsorshipQuerySet's approved method and for
# the sponsorship.contract reverse lookup.
